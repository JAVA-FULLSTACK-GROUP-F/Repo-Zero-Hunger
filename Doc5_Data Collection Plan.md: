Data Collection Plan	
Purpose of Data Collection	

The purpose of data collection is to help the Nutritional Monitoring and Tracking System (NMTS) provide real-time analysis of people's nutritional intake to ensure they receive the appropriate amount of nutrients, and help solve zero hunger.

Data Sources
1. User Input

The primary data source for the NMTS is user input. Users will be asked to provide information about their meals, cooking methods, and nutrient interactions, medical conditions, medications, age, lifestyle, exercise habits, and other relevant information.

2. Nutrient Databases

The NMTS will use nutrient databases to obtain the nutritional values of different foods, including their macronutrient and micronutrient content.

3. Fitness Trackers

The NMTS will also use fitness trackers to collect information on users' exercise habits and physical activity levels.

Data Collection Methods
1. Surveys and Questionnaires

Surveys and questionnaires will be the primary data collection method for the NMTS. Users will be asked to provide information about their meals, cooking methods, and nutrient interactions, medical conditions, medications, age, lifestyle, exercise habits, and other relevant information.

2. Food Logs

Users may also be asked to keep a food log to track their daily meals, including portion sizes and cooking methods.

3. Fitness Tracker Data

The NMTS may also collect data from fitness trackers, including users' physical activity levels, exercise habits, and sleep patterns.

4. Medical Records

In some cases, the NMTS may also collect data from users' medical records, with their permission.

Data Storage and Management

All data collected by the NMTS will be securely stored and managed in compliance with relevant data privacy regulations. User data will be kept confidential and will only be used for the purpose of providing nutritional analysis and monitoring.

Data Analysis

The NMTS will use machine learning algorithms to analyze user data and provide real-time feedback on their nutritional intake. The system will also provide personalized recommendations for meals, cooking methods, and nutrient interactions based on each user's unique needs and preferences.
